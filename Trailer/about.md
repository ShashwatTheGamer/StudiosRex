# Animated Trailer

The trailer should be 30 seconds long,

This is what the trailer should highlight.
1. Play and Enjoy minigames
2. Complete Quests
3. Explore New worlds
4. Buy pets, titles etc (Shops)

The highest highlight should be on the minigames,
The trailer should include 3 best minigames of our game...

At the end, it should say "Minigame MadHouse" (or logo) and after that, 
"Made by Studios Rex, in colaboration with Shayan Studios"

The trailer must be done before 12th, as the sound composer will work after that.. and we will launch after that...

### Minigames:
For each minigame, we will provide you with the maps,
and in each minigame, there will be 5 players who will try and attempt the game, in which, some will fail and some will pass...

### Complete quests:
Here, the player will go to our quest giver, who is a "Noob", and a animated tasks list will pop up, and after completing it, he will go back to the noob, who will give the player coins

### Worlds:
The player will go to the place where the portals are placed, the moment he will enter, with lots of animations, the world will open in.

### Shops:
The background will be a shop, and in 1 second, a title will pop up on the players head, and after that, a pet will appear from behind the player.

**You will be provided will each and every assets, and you can cut some parts to make the total time 30 seconds...**
